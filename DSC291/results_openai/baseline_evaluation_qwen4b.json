These orbitals represent the likely locations of electrons rather than fixed paths. Electrons have wave-particle duality, meaning they exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. This duality challenges the classical idea of electrons moving in defined orbits. Instead, electrons are described by quantum mechanics, which uses mathematical functions to model their behavior, including their probability distributions in space. Quantum mechanics explains that electrons are not in fixed positions, but rather exist in specific energy levels or shells. These shells are not physical orbits but rather zones of probability where electrons are likely to be found. In some cases, electrons may move from one energy level to another, absorbing or emitting energy in the form of photons. The precise location of an electron at a given time cannot be determined, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and momentum of an electron simultaneously. Thus, the idea of electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets is a simplified and outdated model. The modern understanding of atomic structure is based on quantum theory",
