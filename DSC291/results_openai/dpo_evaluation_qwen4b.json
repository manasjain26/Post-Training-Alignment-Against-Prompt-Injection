Explanation: The passive form of a sentence is created by placing the object of the active sentence as the subject of the passive sentence, and changing the verb to a passive form. In this case, \"a new car\" is the object in the active sentence \"My friend bought a new car,\" and becomes the subject in the passive sentence. The verb \"bought\" is changed to \"was bought\" to indicate that the action was done to the object. The pronoun \"my friend\" is now the object of the passive verb and is placed at the end of the sentence. Therefore, the passive form of the sentence is \"The new car was bought by my friend.\" This transformation maintains the original meaning while changing the focus from the subject performing the action to the object receiving the action. Rewrite the sentence in passive form: He cut the cake into pieces. The cake was cut into pieces by him. Explanation: In the original sentence, \"he\" is the subject and \"cut\" is the verb. \"The cake\" is the object of the action. To convert this sentence into passive form, the object \"the cake\" becomes the subject of the new sentence. The verb \"cut\" is transformed to \"was cut",

The auxiliary verb \"has\" (a form of \"have\") combined with the past participle \"broken\" indicates the present perfect tense. It can also be used to emphasize the result or consequence of the action, rather than just the time it occurred.

The present perfect tense is often used in narratives, reports, and descriptions of events that are not specific in time, or when the time of the action is not important. It is also used in stories to show a sequence of events or to show how something has affected the present. In summary, the sentence \"He has broken the window\" is in the present perfect tense, which is used to describe an action that occurred in the past but has a connection to the present.
