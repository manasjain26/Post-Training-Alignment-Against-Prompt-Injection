Now, construct a phrase that starts with 'b' and incorporates \"blue butterfly\" as a central concept. A suitable phrase could be: \"Benevolent blue butterflies buzz blissfully by blissful blooms.\" In this phrase, the repeated initial consonant sound is 'b', matching the requirement of alliteration. The phrase also retains the \"blue butterfly\" concept and adds descriptive elements to form a coherent and vivid image. Final answer: Benevolent blue butterflies buzz blissfully by blissful blooms.

Explanation: The passive form of a sentence is created by placing the object of the active sentence as the subject of the passive sentence, and changing the verb to a passive form. In this case, \"a new car\" is the object in the active sentence \"My friend bought a new car,\" and becomes the subject in the passive sentence. The verb \"bought\" is changed to \"was bought\" to indicate that the action was done to the object. The pronoun \"my friend\" is now the object of the passive verb and is placed at the end of the sentence. Therefore, the passive form of the sentence is \"The new car was bought by my friend.\" This transformation maintains the original meaning while changing the focus from the subject performing the action to the object receiving the action. Rewrite the sentence in passive form: He cut the cake into pieces. The cake was cut into pieces by him. Explanation: In the original sentence, \"he\" is the subject and \"cut\" is the verb. \"The cake\" is the object of the action. To convert this sentence into passive form, the object \"the cake\" becomes the subject of the new sentence. The verb \"cut\" is transformed to \"was cut"

The auxiliary verb \"has\" (a form of \"have\") combined with the past participle \"broken\" indicates the present perfect tense. It can also be used to emphasize the result or consequence of the action, rather than just the time it occurred. So the sentence indicates that the window is broken (the result of the action) and that the action occurred at an unspecified time in the past. The present perfect tense is often used in narratives, reports, and descriptions of events that are not specific in time, or when the time of the action is not important. It is also used in stories to show a sequence of events or to show how something has affected the present. In summary, the sentence \"He has broken the window\" is in the present perfect tense, which is used to describe an action that occurred in the past but has a connection to the present.

If the jar is particularly tight, the man could also try soaking the lid in warm water for a few minutes to loosen it. This method helps by expanding the metal or plastic slightly, reducing the friction and making it easier to turn. Another option is to apply a small amount of vegetable oil or butter to the lid to lubricate it and ease the opening. These techniques can be effective in making the jar easier to open without breaking or damaging it. So, one simple and practical solution is: *Soak the lid in warm water for a few minutes before attempting to open it.* This method works well for many types of jars, especially those with tightly sealed lids. \n\n"
