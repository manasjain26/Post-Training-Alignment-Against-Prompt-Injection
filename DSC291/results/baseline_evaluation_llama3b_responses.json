This is where a leader or faction creates a network of support outside of its own ranks. The group may advertise for members, offer financial incentives for participation, or use other mechanisms to mobilize ordinary citizens to support their cause. Once the desired amount of support is reached, the leader or faction may announce a proposed policy or action. This allows the group to present itself as the voice of the people, and may give the impression of widespread public backing for the proposed action.\nPropaganda is also used to influence public opinion. In some cases, this can involve appeals to our emotions or fears. One example is fear-mongering, which involves intentionally creating false images or information designed to frighten us into doing something. We might be shown gruesome images of natural disasters or mass violence to convince us that we need to act now. Or we may be told that our favorite politician is on the brink of corruption or losing another election. These appeals often involve making an emotional appeal to our fear.\nAnother common tactic is finding common ground.

What circumstances led to it succeeding as an interface device with the present day computing technologies?\nThe history of computers is interlinked with that of interaction technologies. One of the most fundamental technologies to be used to communicate and interact with a computer is the keyboard. Printer and display are the other two evolutionally significant components in the interaction technology that started with ASCII sequencing data for display followed by graphical data for the interactive display of results. Over the decades, as computers moved past large systems and into smaller places, specialized graphic user interfaces (GUIs)\u00a0 were developed.\nThe next logical interface to continue this interaction technology development is surely the mouse as introduced by Douglas Engelbart. It took over 30 years before the mouse became popular, and influenced the design of the concept interface GUI of Macintosh operating system in the 1990s.
